# anura-sprite-canvas-size
A simple plug-in for the GIMP which will make it much easier to resize the sizes of sprites within the sprite sheets for Anura. While this program doesn't have to be exclusively for Anura, it will be primarily be focused on Anura.

For examples of what Anura's sprite sheets look like, see [this spritesheet I made](https://github.com/Autofire/elemedals/blob/master/images/pivot/pivot_basic.png). While I don't expect a lot of interest in this, if anyone is curious, just create a new issue or something. But who knows. I decided to leave it on the Saddleback group in case someone else is interested.

Credit goes where credit is due. In this case, the initial code came from [this guide](http://developer.gimp.org/writing-a-plug-in/1/index.html). And the Anura engine is [here](https://github.com/anura-engine/anura).
